# Filter

&nbsp;

## Overview
The Filter is used to filter the result based on user selection. Users can filter on variables of different types including numberic, text, or visual filters. For each type of variable, there are different filter components including range sliders, multi-selections with autocomplete, and bounding boxes on the map. These filters will carry along in the Voyage app and Past app and affect other components. This page will introduce these filters extensively.

&nbsp;

## Range Slider

The Range Slider is used for selecting value ranges for numberic values. The component uses MUI components `Slider` and `Input` and support features including: 

- setting the default range as minimum and maximum values of the variable selected
- drag the slider to change the range
- click on the slider bar to change the range
- enter values in the input boxes to change the range
- adjust the value to minimum or maximum when the value entered in the input box is out of range

An example Range Slider component looks like following:
